# Quote Generator
## What is it?

---
This is a simple quote generator that was built whilst following the JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects course from the wonderfull people at [ZTM](https://zerotomastery.io/) (Zero to Mastery).

Once loaded, it will show a random quote and whom it is from!
You can then either click "New Quote" and it will pick from any of the 100's of quotes pulled from an API or you can "tweet" that quote!

Pretty neat right?

## How does it work?

---
You can either download the code and run it locally or visit the Github hosted page and see it in action!

[Try it Live!](https://g-h4wke.github.io/quote-generator/)

Quote Generator uses Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. We are using one of the many quote generators out there to make an async api request and storing that JSON response.

Once we have the response, we are pulling out a single quote at a random index and displaying the text and author to you.

We have also added functionality of sending that quote using a template literal to twitter.
